            <h1>Park Street Cemetery</h1>
            <p> South Park Street Cemetery is one of the earliest ‘non-church’ graveyards that exists in the entire world and, at the time it was founded, was the largest outside of Europe and America.  

                The cemetery originally opened in 1767, around the time that the British Empire started to develop in Bengal. 
                
                It was built as the old burial ground was getting full and was receiving too many bodies.
                <br><br>
                One of the most unusual attractions in Kolkata is the abandoned South Park Street Cemetery. 

                It’s a hidden secret amongst the bigger attractions and you would totally miss it if you weren’t looking for it.
                
                This gothic graveyard was established in the 18th century and was used for British officers and their families. But, it was closed off just a few decades later. 
                
                Although this cemetery has stopped receiving the dead, thousands of the living visit each year, and many believe that it’s haunted.
                
                It’s also been named the most haunted place in Kolkata. So, if you’re into your dark tourism, this place will be right up your street.
