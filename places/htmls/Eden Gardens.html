                The stadium was established in 1864. It takes its name from the Eden Gardens, one of the oldest parks in Kolkata, adjacent to the stadium, designed in 1841 and named after the Eden sisters of Lord Auckland, the then Governor-General of India. Initially it was named 'Auckland Circus Gardens' but later changed to 'Eden Gardens' by its makers inspired by the Garden of Eden in the Bible. According to popular culture, Babu Rajchandra Das, the then zamindar (landlord) of Kolkata, had gifted one of his biggest gardens besides the river Hooghly, to Viceroy Lord Auckland Eden and his sister Emily Eden after they helped him by saving his 3rd daughter from a fatal disease. From then onwards the garden's name was changed from Mar Bagan to Eden Gardens. The cricket grounds were built between Babughat and Fort William. The stadium is in the B. B. D. Bagh area of the city, near the State Secretariat and opposite to the Calcutta High Court.
                <br><br>
                The first recorded Test at the venue was held in 1934 between England and India, its first One Day International in 1987 between India and Pakistan and its first T20 international in 2011 between India and England. The Hero Cup semi-final featuring India and South Africa was the first day/night match. The stadium also hosted matches of the inaugural edition of Nehru Cup.
